# flask-app web-app Architecture
This is everything you need to get started with your web-app using Flask. 

This code skeleton has all the required folders for your HTML templates, your CSS stylesheets, your routing, etc.

# How do I use it?
You can just pull the repository, and start building on it.

## Where should I add my files?

- HTML documents: `app/templates`
- CSS stylesheets: `app/static/styles`
- assets (images, videos, sounds, etc): `app/static/assets` (you'll need to create that folder)
- environment, Procfile, requirements: at the root `/`

## What files should I update?

- routes: `app/routes.py`
- models: `app/models.py`
